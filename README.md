# Albert221's layouts

All these layouts are shared on MIT license, so you have to attribute me as an original author of these layouts. Feel free to use them where you want and how you want. If you want you can send me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@albercik221) or on [Facebook](https://fb.com/albert.wolszon) if you used one of these layouts somewhere. I'd be happy to hear that :)

## Build

To build these layouts use `npm install && gulp` to compile Sass to CSS and concatenate JavaScripts.
